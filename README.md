# Machine-Learning-Assessment-2019

## Machine Learning Project on Boston Housing Dataset


### Project Instructions

This assessment concerns the well-known Boston House Prices dataset and the
Python packages **scipy**, **keras**, and **jupyter**. 

**Describe**: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer
to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. Within
the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and
plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset. 

**Infer**: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential
statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices
between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t. You should
explain and discuss your findings within the notebook. 

**Predict**: Again using the same notebook, use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price 
based on the other variables in the dataset.


### IDE and python packages

Jupyter notebook was used as the IDE for this project and the Anaconda distribution was used for importing packages such as keras and scipy. 

Anaconda version 2019.10 was installed with Python 3.7. 

Note to install Keras and tensorflow I entered the following command -c conda-forge keras tensorflow, in the Anaconda prompt. While I had no issues initially
after installation I had to uninstall Anaconda and reinstall as Tensorflow kept switching to Theano meaning I could not run any code.
